The Sage 
	Character for Slay The Spire

A mechanic who studied about the cult of a blue bird.
She learned flying a carpet and brewing potions in order to stop its rise.

Starts with 50 HP, 169 gold	

Idea: It would be cool if we could have "true" intent display. If you don't have enough Flight, the rear enemies should have their regular Attack damage displayed instead of half (to avoid bad surprises). The displayed value only needs to change when Flight changes, since it doesn't have anything to do anymore with Block.

_____________________________

TODO: Cross mod issues:
For the following potions, the displayed potency variable is changed, but the effect doesn't change (but they also don't really work with Sacred Bark so I'm not sure if we should care anyways):
	"BottledKami:Reimu" 
		- Advent 1 random Kami.
	"GrandPatriotsElixir:ReiMu" 
		- Gain 13 Vigor.
	"HakureiPotion:ReiMu" 
		- Add 1 to all stackable buffs (e.g. Strength, Dex) on you.
	"JyouchiReiPotion" (KomeijiMod) 
		- Apply 3 Bound Spirit to an enemy.
	"LiquidFlight:ReiMu" 
		- Gain 2 Flight.
	"PPointPotion" (KomeijiMod) 
		- Gain 3 P point (can't exceed limit).
	"MagicPotion:ReiMu" 
		- Set your [E] to the amount it was at the start of this turn. Gain 1 energy at the start of the next 3 turns. (here, the number of turns is the magic number)
	"ZuzhouPotion:ReiMu"
		- Add 1 to all stackable debuffs (e.g. Weak, Vuln) on the target. 
	"JungleJuicePotion" (The Jungle)
		- Gain 5 Strength and receive 5 Poison. (Event only potion, not really important. Both numbers in the description change to 8. The actual effect is 8 Strength 5 Poison - which I would also suggest as effect. Maybe just keep it with the display bug.)
	"potionbrewer:BlacksmithPotion"
		- Upgrade 1 random card in your deck (only outside of combat). (Numbers change but the effect doesn't.) 

Blacklist:
	"RedTea" (KomeijiMod) 
		- Red tea is good for sleep. (Gives a stun-like effect for 3 turns. I don't think the sleep effect can be stacked, so this should go to the blacklist.)
	"SCP261:BostonMolassesPotion" 
		- Apply Slow. (Slow cannot be stacked. Could give additional stacks of "card plays" like potionbrewer:FreezingPotion)
	"UndeadPotion"
		- Lose 10 Max HP, this combat your HP cannot go below 1. (Can't use in Boss combat.)
	"jedi:holywater"
		- Remove ALL debuffs from yourself.
	"jedi:mysterypotion"
		- The next room you can go to, other than bosses, becomes a ? room. Cannot be used in The Ending. (could be a 2x potion, but it also doesn't work with Sacred Bark)
	"jedi:wingpotion"
		- You may ignore paths when choosing the next room to travel to once. (could be a 2x potion, but it also doesn't work with Sacred Bark)
	"MarkedMod:BlackLotusJuice"
		- Enter Dance of Death. (Costum Stance to interact with Mark keyword.)
	"TwistedElixir" (The Jungle)
		- Make an enemy stronger and gain special rewards based on the size of its health when this is thrown. (Potions from the Jungle can only spawn from an event, not worth the hassle.)
	"HauntedGourdPotion" (The Jungle)
		- Discover a Skill Power and Attack which cost 0 this turn. Add a random Curse and Slimed to your hand. (Could be discovery potion but it is for 1 event only so not really worth implementing)
	"SneckoExtractPotion" (The Jungle)
		- Drink this and something extremely random will happen. (Gives huge amount of random powers, i.e. buffs and debuffs from the game. Could also be whitelisted, but that wouldn't make much of a difference i guess)
	"AntidotePotion" (The Jungle)
		- Remove all Poison Frail Weakness and Vulnerable and heal for each point removed. (Could be heal 2 but again, it's event only, so prob not worth implementing)


Whitelist (apply twice):
	"DemoMod:BlankPotion" (Enter The Gungeon Mod)
		- Deal 3 damage to all enemies. Stun them this turn. (At the moment, only the damage is increased, not the stun.)
	"potionbrewer:BarricadePotion"
		- Double your Block. (Upgrade currently does nothing, Text changes with Sacred Bark (double your Block 2 times), then there is a magic number that is changed to "3 times" but effect doesnt change. Not sure about the effect though - might be better balanced if it gave +150% instead of +200%. Still "quadruple-ing" sounds fun)
	"potionbrewer:BoundlessPotion"
		- Double your Strength. (Same issues as with BarricadePot)

Card Potions:
	"PinkPotion:ReiMu" 
		- This is a Discovery potion for pink (reimu) cards, should work like other Discovery potions.
	"jedi:hoardpotion"
		- Add all cards from current card reward screen to your deck. (In Jedimod, this upgrades all cards if you have Sacred Bark. Maybe the upgraded potion could just do the same?)

Should use text/ magic number from Sacred Bark:
	"potionbrewer:DiscountPotion"
		- A (2) random card in your hand cost 0 this combat. (works fine, just the text for upgraded potion without sacred bark doesnt change)
	"potionbrewer:QuicksilverPotion"
		Prevent the next time (next 2 times) you would take damage. (same here)
	"potionbrewer:StunPotion"
		Stun the enemy for 1 turn (2 turns). (This even has a changing magic number but plural would be nice)

other issues:
	"SCP261:BlastolaColaPotion"
		- Gain 1 orb slots. Channel 5 Frost. (Upgrade only changes the first number, but also gives 10 Frost despite saying 5. Probably hardcoded for Sacred Bark?)
	"SCP261:ThunderBarPotion"
		- Gain 1 orb slots. Channel 5 Lightning. (same issue here)
