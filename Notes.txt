Disoriented: Extremely hard or impossible to implement:
			 Idea: patch abstract action manager to scan every damageaction and damageallenemiesaction. Check the owner.
			 If the owner has the power disoriented, remove the first damaging action you find (ignore damage type thorns)
			 and then add the owner of damageinfo to a HashSet for the turn that keeps track of alraedy disoriented monsters
			 ALSO: Different patch to actually display the right damage to the player
