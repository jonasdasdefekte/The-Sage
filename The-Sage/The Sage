TODO: investigate upgraded potion shop render

Idea: It would be cool if we could have "true" intent display. If you don't have enough Flight, the rear enemies should have their regular Attack damage displayed instead of half (to avoid bad surprises). The displayed value only needs to change when Flight changes, since it doesn't have anything to do anymore with Block.

_____________________________

Cross mod issues:
For the following potions, the displayed potency variable is changed, but the effect doesn't change (but they also don't really work with Sacred Bark so I'm not sure if we should care anyways):
	"BottledKami:Reimu" 
		- Advent 1 random Kami.
	"GrandPatriotsElixir:ReiMu" 
		- Gain 13 Vigor.
	"HakureiPotion:ReiMu" 
		- Add 1 to all stackable buffs (e.g. Strength, Dex) on you.
	"JyouchiReiPotion" (KomeijiMod) 
		- Apply 3 Bound Spirit to an enemy.
	"LiquidFlight:ReiMu" 
		- Gain 2 Flight.
	"PPointPotion" (KomeijiMod) 
		- Gain 3 P point (can't exceed limit).
	"MagicPotion:ReiMu" 
		- Set your [E] to the amount it was at the start of this turn. Gain 1 energy at the start of the next 3 turns. (here, the number of turns is the magic number)
	"ZuzhouPotion:ReiMu"
		- Add 1 to all stackable debuffs (e.g. Weak, Vuln) on the target. 

Blacklist:
	"RedTea" (KomeijiMod) 
		- Red tea is good for sleep (stun-like effect for 3 turns). I don't think the sleep effect can be stacked, so this should go to the blacklist.
	"SCP261:BostonMolassesPotion" 
		- Apply Slow. (Slow cannot be stacked. Alternatively "...to all enemies"? But this would intersect with our Blowpipe relic)
	"UndeadPotion"
		- Lose 10 Max HP, this combat your HP cannot go below 1. (Can't use in Boss combat.)
	"jedi:holywater"
		- Remove ALL debuffs from yourself.
	"jedi:mysterypotion"
		- The next room you can go to, other than bosses, becomes a ? room. Cannot be used in The Ending. (could be a 2x potion, but it also doesn't work with Sacred Bark)
	"jedi:wingpotion"
		- You may ignore paths when choosing the next room to travel to once. (could be a 2x potion, but it also doesn't work with Sacred Bark)

Card Potions:
	"PinkPotion:ReiMu" 
		- This is a Discovery potion for pink (reimu) cards, should work like other Discovery potions.
	"jedi:hoardpotion"
		- Add all cards from current card reward screen to your deck. (In Jedimod, this upgrades all cards if you have Sacred Bark. Maybe the upgraded potion could just do the same?)

other issues:
	"SCP261:BlastolaColaPotion"
		- Gain 1 orb slots. Channel 5 Frost. (Upgrade only changes the first number, but also gives 10 Frost despite saying 5. Probably hardcoded for Sacred Bark?)
	"SCP261:ThunderBarPotion"
		- Gain 1 orb slots. Channel 5 Lightning. (same issue here)
